# BuildOrBail - App Idea Validation Platform

## Overview

BuildOrBail is a full-stack web application that provides brutally honest AI-powered feedback on app ideas. Users submit their app concepts and receive detailed analysis including strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and actionable recommendations. The application uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze submissions and provides a scoring system with "BUILD", "BAIL", or "CAUTION" verdicts.

## User Preferences

- **Communication Style**: Simple, everyday language
- **UI Design**: Modern, breathtaking interfaces with sophisticated color schemes and glass morphism effects
- **Theme Preference**: Dark mode with purple/blue gradient color palettes over harsh red themes

- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management
- **Fallback Storage**: In-memory storage implementation for development/testing
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-based session storage with connect-pg-simple

### Database Schema
- **app_ideas**: Stores user-submitted app concepts with fields for name, description, target market, budget, features, and competition analysis
- **validation_results**: Stores AI analysis results linked to app ideas, including scores, verdicts, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, detailed analysis, and action items

## Key Components

### AI Integration
- **Provider**: Google Gemini AI via @google/genai
- **Service**: Structured prompt engineering for app idea validation
- **Analysis**: Returns scored feedback (1-10) with categorical verdict system
- **Output Format**: JSON-structured responses with arrays for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and action items

### Form System
- **Validation**: Zod schemas with runtime type checking
- **UI Components**: Controlled form inputs with error handling
- **Required Fields**: App name, description, target market
- **Optional Fields**: User name, budget, features, competition analysis
- **Terms Agreement**: Required checkbox for "brutally honest feedback" consent

### Results Display
- **Dynamic Styling**: Color-coded verdicts (green for BUILD, red for BAIL, amber for CAUTION)
- **Structured Layout**: Organized sections for different types of feedback
- **Score Visualization**: Visual representation of 1-10 scoring system
- **Action Items**: Bulleted list of recommended next steps

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: Form submission with app idea details and validation
2. **Data Processing**: Server-side validation using Zod schemas
3. **AI Analysis**: Gemini API call with structured prompts
4. **Data Storage**: Concurrent storage of app idea and validation results
5. **Response Delivery**: Combined result object returned to client
6. **UI Update**: Dynamic rendering of results with smooth scrolling

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@google/genai**: AI analysis integration
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connection
- **drizzle-orm**: Database ORM with type safety
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI component primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **zod**: Runtime schema validation

### Development Tools
- **vite**: Build tool and development server
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development
- **esbuild**: Production bundling
- **@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal**: Development error handling
- **@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer**: Development tooling

## Deployment Strategy

### Multi-Platform Deployment
The application supports deployment on multiple platforms:

#### Replit Deployment (Primary)
- **Client**: Vite builds React application to `dist/public`
- **Server**: esbuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
- **Assets**: Static file serving in production mode
- **Environment**: NODE_ENV-based configuration switching
- **Database**: Automatic PostgreSQL provisioning
- **Storage**: Full DatabaseStorage with all features

#### Netlify Deployment (Secondary)
- **Client**: React app served as static files from `dist/public`
- **Backend**: Serverless functions in `netlify/functions/api.js`
- **Configuration**: `netlify.toml` with redirects and build settings
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL via serverless connection
- **Limitations**: Simplified storage layer, mock analytics, basic rate limiting
- **Requirements**: Manual environment variable setup (`DATABASE_URL`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`)

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Vite dev server with HMR and runtime error overlay
- **Production**: Platform-specific serving (Express for Replit, static + serverless for Netlify)
- **Database**: Environment variable-based connection string
- **AI Service**: API key configuration via environment variables

### Monorepo Structure
- **Shared**: Common schemas and types used by both client and server
- **Client**: React application with UI components and pages
- **Server**: Express API with services and storage abstraction
- **Netlify**: Serverless function adaptations for Netlify deployment
- **Root**: Configuration files and build scripts

The application uses an abstraction pattern that allows switching between platforms while maintaining core functionality. The Replit version provides full features, while the Netlify version is optimized for serverless constraints.
